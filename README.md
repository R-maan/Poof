# Poof
A custom chrome extension for pull requests on github, to hide the changes from dev-tool.
 
This extension can hide all the files which are in `vendor` or `resources` folder of a pull request, as well as auto generated files `*.gen.go`, files in `.circleci`, and `go.mod` and `go.sum` to make the pull request shorter and easier to focus on the files which need to be reviewed.

üëâüèº _This is still WIP (version 0.1.0). Feel free to open issues or raise pull request._
