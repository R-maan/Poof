# Poof
A custom chrome extension for pull requests on github, to hide the changes from dev-tool.
 
This extension can hide all the files which are in `vendor` or `resources` folder of a pull request, as well as auto generated files `*.gen.go`, files in `.circleci`, and `go.mod` and `go.sum` to make the pull request shorter and easier to focus on the files which need to be reviewed.

This is still WIP, but partially usable.

## Installation:
- Download the contents
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Enable Developer mode, top right corner
- In chrome extensions settings, click Load Unpacked
- Select the folder where you downloaded this extension.
- Enable the extension with the switch right corner of this extension’s card
